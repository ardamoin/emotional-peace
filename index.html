                  Welcome! I'm Semra, a Registered Psychotherapist (Qualifying)
                  with the CRPO and a member of CCPA. I hold a Masters (M.A.) in

                helps identify and change troubling emotions, thoughts, and
                behaviors, providing relief from unpleasant symptoms and
                improving daily functioning and quality of life.

                      It's important to know that you don't have to live with
                      anxiety and fear if you experience panic attacks,
                      obsessive thoughts, constant worries, or a phobia. Therapy
                      can help and is often the best way to address many anxiety
                      issues. Therapy equips you with the tools to overcome
                      anxiety and teaches you how to utilize them.

                      hopelessness lasting more than a few days and impacting
                      individuals in various ways. It can significantly impair a

                      Fortunately, depression is highly treatable, and therapy

                      condition. Research suggests that psychotherapy may help
                      alleviate ADHD symptoms, such as irritability, aggression,
                      difficulty paying attention, and hyperactivity.

                      Stress can escalate into chronic stress, eventually
                      resulting in burnout if left untreated. While stress often
                      makes individuals feel overwhelmed, burnout leaves them
                      feeling utterly exhausted, with nothing more to give.
                      Therapy offers strategies to manage and cope with stress

                      As we navigate life's transitions, many changes can be

                      The effects of trauma can deeply impact various aspects of
                      life, leading to long-term consequences. Trauma therapy
                      offers support for coping with both one-time events and

                      self-defeating behaviours with meaningful and rewarding
                      ones. It fosters positive self-perception and emotional

                      People handle stress and overwhelming emotions in various
                      ways. Rather than addressing the issue directly, some may
                      resort to unhealthy distractions or outlets, like anger
                      turning into aggression or developing substance
                      addictions. Therapy offers support in developing positive
                      coping strategies and tools for healthier management.
                      Through open discussion, allowing emotions without being
                      overwhelmed, and focusing on the present, therapy aids in
                      stress management.

                      misunderstandings, deal with negative emotions,

                    Relationship therapy is for any relationship, including
                    couples, family members, friends, and other relationship
                    structures. Relationship-related treatment gives you the
                    tools to overcome emotional distance, lessen
                    misunderstandings, deal with negative emotions, reestablish
                    meaningful connections, and increase your comprehension of
                    the root reasons for unhealthy patterns in your interactions
                    with the people who matter most to you.

                    Every relationship has its ups and downs. But when things
                    become stressful or unavoidable, even the smallest issues
                    can become burdensome for one person or both. Relationship
                    therapy provides tools to overcome emotional distance,
                    minimize misunderstandings, address negative emotions,
                    rebuild meaningful connections, and enhance understanding of
                    dysfunctional patterns between yourself and those who are
                    important to you.

                    individuals in various ways. It can significantly impair a

                    Fortunately, depression is highly treatable, and therapy can

                    anxiety and fear if you experience panic attacks, obsessive

                    Family is an important support system as everyone needs to

                    Family and relationships can include parents, siblings,

                    Occasionally, a child might have a conflict with a loved one
                    or could be experiencing the effects of divorce and being
                    away from a loved one. For caregivers, it's essential to
                    help a child identify who they might be having issues with
                    and help resolve these conflicts.

                    The main aim of behavioural therapy is to replace
                    self-defeating behaviours with meaningful and rewarding
                    ones. It fosters positive self-perception and emotional
                    responses, reducing conflict and enhancing interpersonal
                    relationships. Through therapy, individuals learn to manage
                    negative emotions constructively, gaining control over their
                    reactions.

                  <p>
                    People handle stress and overwhelming emotions in various
                    ways. Rather than addressing the issue directly, some may
                    resort to unhealthy distractions or outlets, like anger
                    turning into aggression or developing substance addictions.
                    Therapy offers support in developing positive coping
                    strategies and tools for healthier management. Through open
                    discussion, allowing emotions without being overwhelmed, and
                    focusing on the present, therapy aids in stress management.

                  <p>
                    Self-esteem is vital for well-being, yet low self-esteem can
                    cause shame, doubt, and hinder relationships and goals.
                    Therapy helps by addressing negative self-talk, fostering
                    self-compassion, and setting achievable goals, leading to
                    improved self-esteem. It's a journey that takes time and
                    effort to overcome old patterns, but progress is possible.
                    Remember, "New things take time to learn." Let's start!

                  <p>
                    Although anger is a natural human emotion, uncontrolled
                    anger can quickly become problematic. Therapy can help you
                    recognize and avoid triggers that provoke anger and provide
                    strategies to manage sudden outbursts. By examining the
                    thoughts preceding your anger, you can learn to resolve
                    conflicts more constructively and mend relationships
                    affected by it.

                    Women may experience emotional challenges related to gender,
                    which can significantly impact mental health and overall
                    well-being. These challenges may encompass anxiety,
                    depression, disordered eating behaviour, postpartum
                    depression, domestic violence, sexual abuse, discrimination,
                    hormonal changes, infertility, and low self-esteem. Choosing
                    to pursue therapy can be a crucial initial step toward
                    healing.

                    Acculturation involves individuals, families, or cultural
                    groups adjusting their original social and cultural values,
                    ideas, beliefs, and behaviours to align with those of a new
                    culture. Differences in immigration and acculturation can
                    impact a person's psychological well-being and overall
                    adaptation to a new culture and country. It influences
                    various aspects of life, including language, behaviour,
                    values, beliefs, and social interactions. We recognize the
                    challenges of multiculturalism, immigration, and
                    acculturation and are here to support your adaptation,
